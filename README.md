# SpotifyClone
Hello Everyone!
I want to share with you the Spotify Clone application that I developed. 
The iOS App consumes the official Spotify Web API to show (and play) songs, artists, albums, and more. 
The user logs in with a Spotify account and permits to access the user's data, user-liked playlists, and songs that the user saved in the library. 
The API service for developers allows songs to be played preview for 29 seconds.
I built this project myself to experience more MVVM Pattern, Protocols, URLSession and REST API.
I'm open to any kind of feedback. Thank you.
